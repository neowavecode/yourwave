                            <p>A: Our app is all about building <strong>genuine friendships</strong>. To do this, we prioritize personalities. The main feature is that we only allow you to upload photos of your face, eliminating superficial judgments so you can get to know people for who they really are.</p>

                            <p>A: The process is simple and designed to create a complete and secure profile:</p>
                            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                                <li>Enter your email and a password. We will send you a confirmation email.</li>
                                <li><strong>IMPORTANT! Check your SPAM folder.</strong> It's very likely our first email will end up there. Open it and click the link to confirm your account. Then, mark it as "Not Spam" to receive future communications without issues.</li>
                                <li>Log in and accept the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</li>
                                <li>Complete your profile: We'll ask for your name, date of birth, gender, and interests.</li>
                                <li>Upload your photos: You must upload a minimum of 3 photos. Remember, our system will only accept <strong>clear photos of your face</strong>. Full-body shots, landscapes, or photos with multiple people are not allowed.</li>
                                <li>Add your bio: You have up to 600 characters to tell us something about yourself.</li>
                                <li>Allow location access: The app uses GPS to show you profiles of people nearby.</li>

                            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-1">Q: How does the discovery screen work?</h3>
                            <p>A: It's the heart of the app. Here you'll see other users' cards. You can interact in the following ways:</p>
                             <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 space-y-1">
                                <li><strong>Swipe LEFT (or press the button):</strong> This is a <strong>"Reject"</strong>. You're not interested in connecting, and that profile won't appear again.</li>
                                <li><strong>Swipe RIGHT (or press the button):</strong> This is a <strong>"Wave"</strong>. It shows you're interested in making a new friend. If they send a Wave back to you, it's a <strong>Connection</strong>!</li>
                                <li><strong>Swipe DOWN (or press the button):</strong> This is a <strong>"Maybe"</strong>. The profile will be saved for later and will reappear in another session, giving you a second chance to decide.</li>
                                <li><strong>Direct Message Button (Premium):</strong> If you're a Premium user, you can send a single direct message to someone you'd really like to connect with, even before you have a Connection. To prevent spam, you can't send more until that person replies.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-1">Q: Will I see ads on this screen?</h3>
                            <p>A: Yes, occasionally and randomly, some profile cards may be ads. This helps us keep the app running for free users. Premium users enjoy an ad-free experience.</p>

The system will verify your account with the app store (Google Play or App Store) and reactivate your Premium subscription if it's still active.

                            <p>A: Almost certainly, the email is in your <strong>SPAM folder</strong>. Check for it there, and once you find it, mark it as "Not Spam" so that future emails arrive in your main inbox.</p>

                            <p>A: This can happen if your device's notification token has expired. The quickest fix is to <strong>log out of the app and log back in</strong>. This will refresh the token and should solve the problem.</p>

                            <p>A: If a user is bothering you or you believe they are violating the rules, you can <strong>block</strong> them from their profile or from the chat. When you block someone, neither of you will be able to see the other's profile or make contact. You can also <strong>report</strong> a profile. All reports are reviewed by our automated system and a human team, and may result in the suspension of the reported user's account.</p>

                            <p>A: If it is determined that you have violated our terms of service, your account will be banned. Your profile will still exist, but it will not be available to other users, and you will not be able to access the app with that email address.</p>
