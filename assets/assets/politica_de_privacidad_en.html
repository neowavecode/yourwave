    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to YourWave. This application is developed and managed by José Jiménez.</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy explains what personal information we collect from our users ("you"), why we collect it, how we use and protect it, and the rights you have over your data. By creating an account on our App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>
    <p>For any questions about this policy or your data, you can contact us at: neowavecode@yourwaveapp.com.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>Information You Provide to Us Directly:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Registration and Profile Data:</strong> Your email address, username, password, date of birth (to verify you are at least 18 years old), gender, profile picture, additional photos, biography, and tastes and interests.</li>
        <li><strong>Profile Photo Analysis:</strong> To ensure that all profile photos comply with our "shoulders-up" portrait rule, your photo is automatically analyzed by an algorithm. <strong>This process occurs entirely on your own device, and your photo is never sent to our servers for this analysis.</strong> The analysis is limited to verifying the image's composition and is not used for biometric identification or any other purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Authentication:</strong> If you sign up through Google, we collect an authentication token and basic data from your Google profile, such as your email and name, to facilitate registration.</li>
        <li><strong>Communications with us:</strong> If you contact our support, we will keep the content of that communication.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Information We Collect Automatically:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage and Activity Information:</strong> We log your activity in the App, such as your interactions with profiles (likes, dislikes, maybes), your search filters, the features you use, and the date and time of your activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect data about your device, such as the hardware model, operating system and version, and unique identifiers.</li>
        <li><strong>Location Information (GPS):</strong> With your explicit permission, we collect precise GPS information from your device to show you nearby profiles and calculate the exact distance between users. You can manage this permission in your phone's settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How and Why We Use Your Information (Legal Basis)</h2>
    <p>We process your data under the following legal bases of the GDPR:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To perform our contract with you (Terms and Conditions):</strong> To create and manage your account and profile; to show you other users' profiles and yours to them; to enable the App's main features, such as chats for Premium users.</li>
        <li><strong>For our legitimate interest in maintaining a safe and functional service:</strong> To perform analysis to improve and optimize the Service; to suggest profiles that may be of interest to you; to prevent fraud, enforce our terms, and protect the security of our users (e.g., by retaining data from banned accounts).</li>
        <li><strong>With your explicit consent:</strong> To access your precise GPS location; to send you promotional push notifications (if implemented); for our advertising partners (like Google AdMob) to show you personalized ads.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Who We Share Your Information With</h2>
    <p>We share information with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Other users:</strong> Your public profile (photos, username, age, biography, interests, and distance) is visible to other users.</li>
        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Third parties that help us operate, such as Supabase (backend), Google (authentication, analytics, ads), and Apple/Google (payments).</li>
        <li><strong>For legal reasons:</strong> If necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or governmental request.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Rights Over Your Data</h2>
    <p>We guarantee you control over your information. You have the following rights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right of Access and Portability:</strong> You can request a copy of your data (in JSON format) from the App's settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You can edit your profile information at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten"):</strong> You can voluntarily delete your account at any time from the settings. This action is permanent.</li>
        <li><strong>Exception to the Right to Erasure for Banned Accounts:</strong> If your account is banned, your data will not be deleted in order to enforce the ban and protect the community, based on our legitimate interest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We keep your data as long as your account is active. If you delete it, it is erased. If it is banned, we retain the information to enforce the ban.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement technical and organizational measures to protect your information, including data encryption and the option to enable biometric access to the App.</p>

    <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service is directed exclusively to individuals 18 years of age or older. We verify age and do not knowingly collect information from minors.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may modify this Policy. If the changes are significant, we will notify you through the App or by other means.</p>
