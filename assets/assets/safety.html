    <h1>Child Safety and Protection Standards on YourWave</h1>

    <p>At YourWave, our priority is to create a safe and respectful environment for all our users. We are firmly committed to combating <strong>Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (CSEA)</strong> and enforce a zero-tolerance policy against any content or behavior that infringes upon the safety of minors.</p>
    <p>Although YourWave is designed for users who are <strong>18 years of age or older</strong>, we implement rigorous security measures to prevent any form of inappropriate contact or content involving minors. Our goal is to ensure that the platform is never used for illegal or harmful purposes.</p>

    <h2>Our Commitment and Safety Measures</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Age Restriction:</strong> YourWave is an application exclusively for users aged 18 and above. We have verification processes in place to help ensure compliance with this restriction.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Moderation:</strong> We implement both an <strong>automated and manual moderation system</strong> to quickly detect and remove any content that violates our policies, including explicit, abusive, or exploitative images, audio, or text. Our team actively reviews profiles and interactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Prevention of Inappropriate Interactions:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Private chats</strong> are monitored by our automated systems to identify suspicious language or communication patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Photos and audio</strong> shared are subject to review and may be removed if they violate our guidelines.</li>
                <li><strong>Geolocation</strong> is used exclusively to connect compatible adult users with their consent, without allowing its use for harassment or locating minors.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Private Profiles:</strong> User profiles are private and only visible within the application to other YourWave users, which limits the exposure of personal information.</li>
        <li><strong>Staff Training:</strong> Our support and moderation team receives ongoing training on child safety policies and protocols for responding to potential CSEA cases.</li>
    </ul>

    </ol>

    <h3>Our Response Process to Reports:</h3>
    <p>All reports are treated with the utmost seriousness and urgency. Our moderation team:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reviews and evaluates</strong> each report thoroughly.</li>
            <li><strong>Acts quickly</strong> to remove infringing content, suspend, or terminate accounts of users who violate our policies, especially in CSEA cases.</li>
            <li><strong>Collaborates with authorities:</strong> In cases of suspected CSEA or illegal activity, YourWave will fully cooperate with relevant law enforcement and child protection agencies, providing necessary information for investigation.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="important-note">
        <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> If you or someone you know has been a victim of CSEA or has information about it, we urge you to contact local authorities or specialized organizations such as the <strong>Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) hotline</strong> or the <strong>National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC)</strong> directly.</p>
